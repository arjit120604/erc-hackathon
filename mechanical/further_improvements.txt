Further Improvements that were planned but couldn't be executed due to improper time utilisation:
<1> Initially we had planned a basic low profile chasis with arm mounted driectly above it, we had also incorporated a digging tool that could be lowered on command and used for excavating any mines that were dug under the mud, but the idea never picked up pace and we disbanded it for some other design. We although believe the design would look very conventional to robots that perform other tasks and could've had a much higher servicability in situations where resources were much scarce.
<2> In the old design.f3d we come across the unconventional design talked about in the readme file, as mentioned the planned weight made the design kind of useless as this design incorporated treads which wouldn't hold much value to propulsion as the design didn't impart much of a pressure on mud to make it sink inot it, although it would be our preference for a low profile robot, we had planned to cut outa section in the middle for mechanical arm while also adding the digger tool we touted in the first point.
<3> After looking through tank designs for treads we found out that there is only one drive wheel on each track i.e. the sprocket used for turning the treads, but given that they are turned using diesel engine or turbine engines that are constrained to only one direction of power supply due to space limitaions, our robot can have multiple sprockets which would aid a ton in propulsion, we were very unsure if the sprcket we designed would work as designing one realisitic enough seemed like a very tough challenge, we have although submitted along a propesed sprocket design we believe we could've made on similar to the realistic one but couldn't due to the reason stated in the header.
<4> A great reason for chosing the main design that we have submitted is that it can be fitted with both treads and normal wheels with protusions
